git version: no git

test:
+ 1MHz sampling, 1e6 array größe

result:
+ continuous: messung läuft, lcd anzeige ok, animation ok, laser analog und digital ok, all workers joined, saving file doesnt work, irgendwas mit x.shape in savtxt

change:
+ data gets processed before, saved only timestamps in shape(i, 2) fmt

result:
+ no file gets saved

change:
+ in savefiles.savetxt change filename[0] to filename

result:
+ file gets saved, but no data

change:
+ print timestamps before they get queued as result from processer to mainwindow

result:
+ prints only the [0, 0] from initialization
+ append on simple arrays with shape(5, 2) returns an array of shape (10,)

change:
+ print(array)

result:
+ print(array) gives nice result
+ append doesnt work
+ test show: appending by np.concatenate is better, especially if it come to huge arrays

change:
+ change to ts = np.concatenate((ts, array))

result:
+ measuring is possible
+ somethings wrong with indices

change:
+ in der korrektur for i in range(len(data)) statt for i in data --> is a double oder sowas

result:
+ fintie mode ok, 30s measurement takes exactly 30s as seen in file
